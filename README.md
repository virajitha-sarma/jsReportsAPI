# Rendering reports using jsReportsAPI. 
This is a POC and the purpose of this project is to understand the feasibility of using JSreports report API. This project is developed using spring boot and not on Boreas framework.

Log detail and Log summary LR-SIEM reporting templates are used with JSReports API to understand how its API can be used to render reports.
The confluence page mentioned below has the sample data and template [TestReporting-SIEMLR-LogSummaryTemplate.pdf] that was used for testing.

More information about the POC and results of testing jsreports with different data sets can be found at https://confluence.logrhythm.com/display/NGP/Rendering+LR+Report+Templates+with+JSReports
